## Agent Notes
 * frustration has settled in as I struggle to find a clear direction for my agent development
 * I have what I would call a decent setup for working with claude interactively. One idea could be to figure out how to package that and see if I can get it installed on Aidan's machine. Another idea is to support that same interactive mode but with memory and state not in GIT, OR we teach him how to manage his state in one project while we are working with and committing in a different directory. Then as he is working and creating branches we don't have to worry about the merge conflicts associated with updating state (something we want to do often) while working. Another option is to teach Heinz how to bactch state changes and be aware of the risks of branching and find the right place to do that part. 
 * There are definitely workflows or ideas that require the agent to be on all the time. That would mean I need to find a hosting solution and do integration with Slack and email so we can talk to the agent and get feedback. We could investigate this Streamlit UI thing that Archon guy did as a first option to get started. The main issue with starting down that path is Python (I should really learn and use it but it will be a slow and painful process I am trying to avoid.)
* Lets talk about agent capabilities: 
    * Memory - So many different options here from basic rag to knowledge graphs to layered strategies for different types of memories. How to sequence the development of memory capabilities? 
        * Note about Claude usage
