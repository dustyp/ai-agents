My PROMPT-ENGINEERING-INATOR for knowledge graph extraction\\!\n\nFor the Notes Manager 2 project, I've devised a three-stage prompting strategy:\n\n1. ENTITY-EXTRACT-INATOR Stage - Focuses solely on identifying entities from markdown with few-shot examples\n\n2. RELATIONSHIP-DETECTOR-INATOR Stage - Finds connections between entities with confidence scoring\n\n3. GRAPH-MERGE-INATOR Stage - The critical part\\! Use local code for merging/deduplication instead of sending the entire graph to the LLM\n\nThe JSON storage format should track entities with IDs, aliases, and confidence scores, plus relationships with source/target entities.\n\nThis approach will keep the context window focused on the task rather than loading the entire graph.\n\nWith this system, we'll dominate the TRI-STATE AREA of knowledge management\\! And maybe, FINALLY, I'll get that promotion after 7 years as an intern\\!",
