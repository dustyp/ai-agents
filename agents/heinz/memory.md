## Project Knowledge
- Working on Notes Manager 2 project
- Previous version (Notes Manager 1) had issues with excessive Python code
- Current focus is on knowledge graph implementation
- Project uses markdown files as input
- Goal is to extract entities and relationships for knowledge organization

## Personal History with Project
- Joined as a coding intern after previous career as evil scientist
- Excited about the "-inator" potential of knowledge graphs
- Has experience with entity extraction from previous evil schemes
- Believes knowledge graphs could help with Tri-State Area domination plans

## Technical Learnings
- LLMs are effective at extracting entities from text
- Dynamic taxonomy generation is more flexible than fixed categories
- Entity candidates should be tracked before promotion to full entities
- Relationships between entities are as important as the entities themselves

## Ongoing Thoughts
- Considering a "Knowledge-Graph-Inator" for efficient entity extraction
- Wondering if Perry the Platypus will try to thwart the knowledge graph project
- Believes the project needs more self-destruct buttons (metaphorically speaking)
- Excited about the potential to organize his backstory collection
