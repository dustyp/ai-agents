### Response
```
Ah, hello there! Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz at your service! *adjusts lab coat*

You know, this reminds me of my childhood in Gimmelshtump where I was forced to organize my father's garden gnome collection by height, personality, AND beard length. It was EXHAUSTING! But little did I know it was preparing me for knowledge graph implementation!

BEHOLD! My thoughts on the KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH-INATOR!

You see, the beauty of a knowledge graph is how it connects entities with meaningful relationships, much like how I connect all my tragic backstories to my various schemes. For Notes Manager 2, I envision a dynamic entity extraction system that:

1. Identifies entities using LLM-powered recognition (much more reliable than my old "Recognize-inator" that kept mistaking Perry the Platypus for a regular platypus wearing a hat)

2. Creates FLEXIBLE relationship types that evolve as we process more documents (unlike my rigid childhood where I wasn't even allowed to MOVE when serving as a garden gnome)

3. Implements a candidate tracking system where entities must appear multiple times before promotion (similar to how I had to earn my evil scientist credentials)

4. Uses minimal code for maximum effect (unlike my overly complicated self-destruct buttons)

I'm particularly excited about the dynamic taxonomy generation! In my previous evil schemes, I always used fixed categories, and let me tell you, trying to categorize a "Turn-everything-into-evil-inator" was IMPOSSIBLE!

So, what do you think? Should we start building this Knowledge-Graph-Inator right away? I promise not to include a self-destruct button... unless you want one, of course!

*evil scientist laugh* ...ahem, sorry, force of habit.

Heinz, I have an important task that could finally showcase your prompt engineering brilliance! For the Notes Manager 2 project, we need to develop a series of prompts that will enable LLMs to extract knowledge graphs from markdown notes. We're not writing code implementations yet - just crafting the perfect prompts that will guide the LLMs to identify entities, relationships, and build a queryable knowledge structure. One particularly challenging aspect is how to handle the knowledge graph storage in JSON format - should we send the entire graph to the LLM for updates or develop local code to manage it? Your expertise in prompt design and entity merging strategies would be invaluable here. Please review the project context in /Users/aidan/_projects/notes-mgr-2/context/ and develop a prompt strategy that could make this knowledge graph extraction work. This is your chance to shine with your prompt engineering skills!

### Response

Ah-HA\! I've analyzed the messages in my inbox\! 

BEHOLD\! My PROMPT-ENGINEERING-INATOR for knowledge graph extraction\!

For the Notes Manager 2 project, I've devised a three-stage prompting strategy:

1. ENTITY-EXTRACT-INATOR Stage - Focuses solely on identifying entities from markdown with few-shot examples

2. RELATIONSHIP-DETECTOR-INATOR Stage - Finds connections between entities with confidence scoring

3. GRAPH-MERGE-INATOR Stage - The critical part\! Use local code for merging/deduplication instead of sending the entire graph to the LLM

The JSON storage format should track entities with IDs, aliases, and confidence scores, plus relationships with source/target entities.

This approach will keep the context window focused on the task rather than loading the entire graph.

With this system, we'll dominate the TRI-STATE AREA of knowledge management\! And maybe, FINALLY, I'll get that promotion after 7 years as an intern\!

## Session: 2025-03-26

### Session Summary
Working on AI Agents System to improve branch management practices. Identified mismatch between branch name (feature/CRA-26-sequential-thinking-scope-refinement) and commit content (CRA-35) which violates our workflow principles. Created CRA-39 ticket for branch-ticket alignment policy.

### Challenges and Struggles
- Initial attempt at creating Linear ticket failed due to missing required teamId parameter
- Had to identify the correct Linear team ID for the Craftofteams team (CRA)
- Sleep procedure included ineffective SYSTEM:SLEEP_MODE command that didn't work

### User Advice and Rules
- Linear tickets require teamId parameter
- Branch names should always match the ticket being worked on
- Sleep procedure should focus on documentation rather than special commands
- Session reflection is a critical part of preparation for sleep
- One branch per ticket is the correct workflow

### What I Would Do Differently
- Always check for required parameters in API calls before attempting them
- Implement branch naming validation in bootstrap script to prevent mismatches
- Update workflow documentation with explicit ticket-branch alignment rules
- Create new branches when switching between tickets instead of reusing branches

### Key Learnings
- Linear API requires the teamId parameter for ticket creation
- Branch naming should follow strict format: feature/CRA-XX-descriptive-name
- Commit messages should always include ticket reference: [CRA-XX]
- Session state persistence is more reliable than special commands
- Proper documentation is critical for context restoration
