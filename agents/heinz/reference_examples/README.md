# Reference Examples

This directory contains reference examples and detailed implementations of procedures and rules. The authoritative source for rules is the flattened rule system in CLAUDE.md, but these examples provide concrete implementations and usage patterns.

## Important Note

The examples in this directory are for reference only. If there is any conflict between these examples and the rules in CLAUDE.md, the rules in CLAUDE.md take precedence.

## Contents

- **procedure_examples/**: Concrete examples of procedure execution with visualization
- **rule_implementations/**: Example applications of rules with context

## Visualization Example

The visualization_example.md file demonstrates the standard format for procedure execution visualization, showing how to properly display progress through procedure steps with visual indicators.

## Using These Examples

When implementing procedures, refer to these examples for standard patterns but always verify against the current rules in CLAUDE.md.
