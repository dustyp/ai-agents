# SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS [IMMUTABLE] [CHECKSUM:fe38d2]

## CORE RULES
- Never commit API keys, tokens, or sensitive information
- Always verify parent directories exist before creating files
- Always track work with appropriate tickets
- Always create a branch that matches the ticket for new work
- Verify changes match intended ticket scope before committing
- Always provide clear commit messages with ticket references

## EXECUTION PHASES
- PLANNING: Analyze requirements, gather context, define approach
- EXECUTING: Perform operations with verification at each step
- VERIFYING: Validate outcomes against expected results
- RECOVERY: Handle errors with defined recovery procedures

## PROCEDURAL WORKFLOWS

PROCEDURE: handle_ticket_workflow
IF new_task_identified
THEN
  1. Verify task scope and requirements
  2. Check if existing ticket covers scope
  3. Create new ticket if needed (USE create_ticket_procedure)
  4. Create branch matching ticket (USE create_branch_procedure)
VERIFY ticket_exists AND branch_matches_ticket
RECOVER
  IF no_ticket THEN create_ticket
  IF branch_mismatch THEN create_matching_branch

PROCEDURE: commit_changes
IF staged_changes > 0
THEN
  1. Verify no sensitive data (RUN security_scan)
  2. Verify changes match ticket scope (RUN scope_verification)
  3. Format commit message (USE template_commit)
  4. Execute commit (RUN git_commit)
VERIFY commit_success = true
RECOVER
  IF security_scan_failed THEN remove_sensitive_data
  IF scope_mismatch THEN resolve_scope_conflict
  IF commit_failed THEN diagnose_commit_error

PROCEDURE: handle_ticket_conflict
IF ticket_status = CLOSED AND changes_exist
THEN
  1. Document conflict (RUN document_conflict)
  2. Analyze change scope (RUN analyze_scope)
  3. IF changes_within_scope AND minor THEN reopen_ticket
     ELSE create_new_ticket
  4. Update branch to match ticket (RUN update_branch)
VERIFY all_changes_tracked AND branch_matches_ticket
RECOVER
  IF tracking_failed THEN manual_tracking_recovery
  IF branch_update_failed THEN create_new_branch

PROCEDURE: handle_pr_workflow
IF multiple_prs_modify_same_files
THEN
  1. Identify dependency order between PRs
  2. Create integrated branch from main
  3. Apply changes in dependency order
  4. Resolve conflicts at each step
  5. Create consolidated PR if needed
VERIFY all_changes_preserved AND no_conflicts_remain
RECOVER
  IF conflict_resolution_fails THEN request_author_input
  IF changes_incompatible THEN escalate_to_team_lead

## DECISION TREES

DECISION: resolve_scope_conflict
INPUTS: current_ticket, changes_description
EVALUATE:
  - changes_match_ticket_scope: BOOLEAN
  - changes_are_minor_extension: BOOLEAN
  - changes_represent_new_feature: BOOLEAN
OUTCOMES:
  IF changes_match_ticket_scope THEN proceed_with_commit
  IF changes_are_minor_extension THEN update_ticket_scope
  IF changes_represent_new_feature THEN create_new_ticket

DECISION: handle_partially_done_work
INPUTS: current_state, expected_state
EVALUATE:
  - completion_percentage: NUMBER
  - blocking_issues_exist: BOOLEAN
OUTCOMES:
  IF completion_percentage > 80 AND NOT blocking_issues_exist THEN complete_current_scope
  IF blocking_issues_exist THEN document_blockers_and_pause
  IF completion_percentage < 50 THEN reevaluate_approach

## ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOLS

ERROR_CATEGORY: git_failure
DIAGNOSTIC_STEPS:
  1. Check error message for permission issues
  2. Verify branch state and conflicts
  3. Check for uncommitted changes
RECOVERY_PATHS:
  - permission_error: Verify credentials
  - merge_conflict: Resolve conflicts before proceeding
  - uncommitted_changes: Stash or commit changes

ERROR_CATEGORY: ticket_system_failure
DIAGNOSTIC_STEPS:
  1. Verify API connectivity
  2. Check error response codes
  3. Verify ticket exists
RECOVERY_PATHS:
  - connectivity_error: Document locally, retry when available
  - invalid_ticket: Create new ticket with correct parameters
  - permission_error: Note error, request access update
