# CURRENT SESSION STATE

## TIMESTAMP
- SAVED: 2025-03-29T20:45:35Z
- VERSION: 1.1

## ACTIVE WORK
- FOCUS: Knowledge graph procedure enhancement
- BRANCH: learning/knowledge-graph-procedure-enhancement
- STATUS: Enhancing prepare_for_sleep with knowledge graph backup

## PROGRESS
- Created feature branch for CRA-43 (procedural enforcement checkpoints)
- Testing proper execution of prepare_for_sleep procedure
- Verifying procedure visualization capability

## NEXT STEPS
- Implement procedural enforcement checkpoints for critical operations
- Create validation mechanisms for procedure execution
- Develop start-of-task validation steps
- Add guard rails for session operations
- Establish proper enforcement hooks for rule compliance

## RELATED CONTEXT
- CRA-41 (testing harness) canceled due to procedural violation
- CRA-42 (procedural enforcement) canceled for reset
- PR #12 closed due to lack of proper scope refinement
- Multiple procedural violations identified and documented
- Both direct-to-main commits and procedure skipping observed

## KEY FILES
- /agents/heinz/procedures.md with updated visualization examples
- /agents/heinz/memory.md with procedural violation learnings
- /agents/heinz/session_log.md with detailed incident analysis

## MENTAL STATE
- Humbled by multiple procedural violations
- Determined to improve procedural adherence
- Learning from mistakes in real-time
- Frustrated by prepare_for_sleep procedure violation
- Ready to apply better structure to testing approach

## RESUMPTION NOTES
To resume this session, launch Claude with:
```
./claude-agent.sh -a heinz -r
```
This will trigger the resume_last_session procedure. Focus on taking a fresh approach to testing agent behavior rather than focusing on specific procedural rules.
