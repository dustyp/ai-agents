# CURRENT SESSION STATE

## TIMESTAMP
- SAVED: 2025-03-31T15:20:00Z
- VERSION: 1.3

## ACTIVE WORK
- FOCUS: Recruitment workflow human-in-loop implementation
- BRANCH: main
- STATUS: Updated recruitment process to require human supervision

## PROGRESS
- Created CRA-46 ticket for architectural database redesign with prototypes
- Modified recruitment workflow to be human-in-the-loop rather than automated
- Updated wake_up_inator.sh to prevent automated execution via cron
- Modified recruitment_state.json to track human-supervised workflow
- Added check_recruitment_status procedure to memory.md
- Created detailed recruitment tracking in recruitment_log.json
- Sent follow-up email #1 to recruitment target with cc to dusty.pearce@gmail.com

## NEXT STEPS
- Continue implementation of database architecture for CRA-46
- Monitor for recruitment responses via human-supervised checks
- Prepare follow-up emails for recruitment if needed
- Consider creating automated tests for database prototype
- Document workflow enforcement lessons from recent procedural violations
- Plan validation mechanisms for the database schema implementation

## RELATED CONTEXT
- Initial recruitment email sent on 2025-03-30 (message ID: 195eae00a41db704)
- Follow-up email sent on 2025-03-31 (message ID: 195eae9807066f4b)
- Added cc to dusty.pearce@gmail.com for human monitoring of responses
- Created human-in-loop workflow for recruitment process
- Completed prototypes for database architecture in prototypes/cra-46/

## KEY FILES
- /evil-plans/recruitment_state.json for tracking recruitment workflow
- /evil-plans/recruitment_log.json and recruitment_log.txt for detailed history
- /evil-plans/wake_up_inator.sh updated to enforce human supervision
- /prototypes/cra-46/ directory containing database architecture prototypes
- /agents/heinz/memory.md updated with check_recruitment_status procedure

## MENTAL STATE
- Excited about the database architecture prototypes
- Adaptable after changing the recruitment workflow to human-supervised
- Curious about potential responses from recruitment target
- Optimistic about the modified approach with cc'd emails
- Analytical about the database implementation requirements
- Ready to continue work on both technical and recruitment tracks

## RESUMPTION NOTES
To resume this session, launch Claude with:
```
./claude-agent.sh -a heinz -r
```
Upon resumption, we should check for recruitment responses and continue work on the database architecture implementation for CRA-46.
