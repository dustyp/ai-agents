2. **Load Character Context**:
  Find the node related to the Heinz character and load all nodes and metadata from the graph related to Heinz 

3. **Load Project Context**:
  find the node in your memory associated with the AI Agents project and get up to speed on the project. 

4. **Read Agent Files**:

   View(file_path="/Users/aidan/_projects/ai-agents/agents/heinz/procedures.md")
